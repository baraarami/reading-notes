# *Summary of Variables
The Java programming language uses both "fields" and "variables" as part of its terminology. Instance variables (non-static fields) are unique to each instance of a class. Class variables (static fields) are fields declared with the static modifier; there is exactly one copy of a class variable, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. Local variables store temporary state inside a method. Parameters are variables that provide extra information to a method; both local variables and parameters are always classified as "variables" (not "fields"). When naming your fields or variables, there are rules and conventions that you should (or must) follow.

The eight primitive data types are: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char. The java.lang.String class represents character strings. The compiler will assign a reasonable default value for fields of the above types; for local variables, a default value is never assigned. A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

 # *Summary of operators :
 the following quick reference summarizes the operators supportes by the java programming language .

Unary Operators
+       Unary plus operator; indicates
        positive value (numbers are 
        positive without this, however)
-       Unary minus operator; negates
        an expression
++      Increment operator; increments
        a value by 1
--      Decrement operator; decrements
        a value by 1

?:      Ternary (shorthand for 
        if-then-else statement)
Type Comparison Operator
instanceof      Compares an object to 
                a specified type 
Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators

 # Controle Flow Statment :
 This seaction describes the control flow statment supported by the java programming language 

 ##### coted words from the site :
# *Summary of Control Flow Statements
The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true. The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false. Unlike if-then and if-then-else, the switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths. The while and do-while statements continually execute a block of statements while a particular condition is true. The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top. Therefore, the statements within the do block are always executed at least once. The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. It has two forms, one of which was designed for looping through collections and arrays.
