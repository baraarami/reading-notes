# Exceptions 

### what is an Exception ?
An exception is an event that occure during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions .


A program can use exeptions to indicate thwt an error occurred , a program can catch execptions by using an a combination of the try , catch and finally blocks


1. the try block identifies a block of code in which an exeption can occer 
2. the catch block identifies a block of code , known as an exeption handler , that can handel a particuler type of exception 
3. the finally block identifire a block of code that is guaranteed to execute , and is the right place to close files , recover resources , and otherwise clean up after the code enclosed in the try block 


# Scanning 
 Programming I/O often involves translating to and from the neatly for data humans like to work with . To assits you with these chores , the java platform provides two APIs 
 The scanner API breaks input into individual tokens associated with bits of data .
 The formating API assembles data into nicely formatted , human-readable form . 

What Is a Path?
The following figure shows a sample directory tree containing a single root node. Microsoft Windows supports multiple root nodes. Each root node maps to a volume, such as C:\ or D:\. The Solaris OS supports a single root node, which is denoted by the slash character, /.
