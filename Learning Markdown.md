# What is Markdown ?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web and it's another way to write HTML pages. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

we can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

1. Gists
2. Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
3. Files with the .md or .markdown extension


|Syntax guide |Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3  | 
|:--- |:---- |:----:| ----:|
|1. Headers | # This is an <h1> tag | ## This is an <h2> tag | ###### This is an <h6> tag |
|2. Emphasis | *This text will be italic* | **This text will be bold** | **_You can combine them_**  |
|3. Lists | Unordered : denoted by (*) | Ordered : numbered |
|4. Images |![Alt Text](url) |
|5. Links | [GitHub](http:// and type here the link) |
|6. Blockquotes | > We're living the future so |
|7. Inline code | I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead. |
