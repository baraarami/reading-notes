# Introducing CSS
In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS. CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

The key to understanding how CSS works is to
imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element.

CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts:  *a selector* and *a declaration*.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

Useing External CSS like link , href , type , rel .
Useing Internal CSS like style.

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
