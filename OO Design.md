# SOLID 

### What the SOLID is/are ?

First of all let's see what's stand for :
The letter "*S*"is for :  Single-responsiblity Principle
The letter "*O*"is for :  Open-closed Principle
The letter "*L*"is for :  Liskov Substitution Principle
The letter "*I*"is for :  Interface Segregation Principle
The letter "*D*"is for :  Dependency Inversion Principle

It's an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles.

## The Single-responsiblity Principle what it is doing ?
 A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
 
 
 ## The Open-closed Principle what it is doing ?
 Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
*This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.*
 
 ## The Liskov Substitution Principle what it is doing ?
 Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
 *This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.*

## The  Interface Segregation Principle what it is doing ?
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## The Dependency Inversion Principle what it is doing ?
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
##### *This principle allows for decoupling.*
