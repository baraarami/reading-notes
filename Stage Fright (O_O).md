# Taking Steps to Overcome Your Fear
Learning to improve your speaking or performance skills is good, but it’s generally not enough to substantially reduce your fear. You must address and revise any negative perceptions, beliefs, thoughts, images, and predictions related to public speaking or performing. And it’s often helpful to uncover the deeper fears related to being seen and heard by others, showing vulnerability, and being considered less than perfect. Learning to accept yourself and not feeling that you have to prove yourself to others is at the root of healing.


Try these 10 tips to reduce your stage fright:

Shift the focus from yourself and your fear to your true purpose—contributing something of value to your audience.
Stop scaring yourself with thoughts about what might go wrong. Instead, focus your attention on thoughts and images that are calming and reassuring.
Refuse to think thoughts that create self-doubt and low confidence.
Practice ways to calm and relax your mind and body, such as deep breathing, relaxation exercises, yoga, and meditation.
Exercise, eat well, and practice other healthful lifestyle habits. Try to limit caffeine, sugar, and alcohol as much as possible.
Visualize your success: Always focus on your strength and ability to handle challenging situations.
Prepare your material in advance and read it aloud to hear your voice.
Make connections with your audience: Smile and greet people, thinking of them as friends rather than enemies.
Stand or sit in a self-assured, confident posture. Remain warm and open and make eye contact.
Give up trying to be perfect and know that it is OK to make mistakes. Be natural, be yourself.


First, be sure to research all of your points so you feel confident about the information you are sharing. Second, once you are sure of your content, practice your speech in front of friends. Every time a qualifier or caveat is added, friends should gently point it out and have you start over. The best speakers also know that not everyone is going to like them. In fact, some of the best speakers are controversial, and that’s a good thing! You want people to get riled up, get thinking and feel emotion. That means you are striking a chord!
