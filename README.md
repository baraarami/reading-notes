 # Growth Mindset  :brain: :nerd_face: 
The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility , and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
There is a two different mindset :
1. Fixed mindset which is :
* avoid challenges .
* loses focuse .
* ignore the mestakes that our college fall in . 
* and that views as a threat.

2. Growth mindset which is :
 * embraces about challinges tasks . 
 * no pain,no gain .
 * learns frome other mestakes . 
 * and inspired by success of others .

  You will face many difficult stages and challenges in the beginning  :exploding_head: , but it's ok as mr.yahya saids couse it's normally to get confused .
  Then we saids that when we hit a roadblock we shoud get over it and solve it if it bossible . do more effort , and i also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done .So I’ve learned today to ask myself two questions:

1. What was the best part of the day?
2. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?

These questions help me focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad, and they help me internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.

I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work .

# There are 3 reminders to myself of how to keep me in a growth mindset:
1.  Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.

" Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them."

2.  I Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”

" When i make a mistake or fall short of a goal, i haven’t failed; i’ve learned." 

3.  Highlight the relationship between learning and brain training.

" The brain is like a muscle that needs to be worked out, just like the body."
