# The code I’m still ashamed of
## *"As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices."*
>  I was very touched by this line of the article, I do not want to have a single line of code that I will regret writing later.

One of the most important reasons that prompted me to get involved in the field of software development,
is to provide applicable and practical solutions to the problems of my community and problems related to the goals of sustainable development.
First of all, before I call myself a developer, I am a member of this world and this society.
So when I write any line of code, I must put this idea in front of my eyes, what is its impact, what is its goal and what is the purpose behind it.
Perhaps we will be exposed to a situation of engaging in a project that violates my principles or positions despite the possibility of a large financial return;
but the truth - that the goal remains, not the material - we will face many difficulties if you do not carry the same motive and principles that started all this,
there will come a time when you will lose all This is because you aimlessly followed the material that will inevitably have an end point at some point.
## Software Engineering Code of Ethics

Software engineers must pledge to make software analysis, specification, design, development, testing, and maintenance a profitable and recognized career. Software developers must observe the following Eight Principles as part of their responsibility to the public's health, safety, and welfare: PUBLIC Software developers are expected to behave in the public interest. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER Software engineers must operate in the best interests of their client and employer while also keeping the public interest in mind. PRODUCT Software developers must guarantee that their products and changes adhere to the highest professional standards. JUDGMENT Software engineers must use professional judgment with honesty and independence. MANAGEMENT Managers and leaders in software engineering must adhere to and support an ethical approach to software development and maintenance. PROFESSION Software engineers should promote the profession's ethics and reputation in the public interest. COLLEAGUES Software developers must treat their coworkers with respect and be supportive of them. SELF Software engineers must engage in lifelong learning about the practice of their job and advocate an ethical attitude to it.
## The code I’m still ashamed of

Bill Sourour wrote an essay titled "The code I'm still embarrassed of" about his experience writing code for a pharmaceutical firm that was selling a certain medication. He hadn't given much thought to the questionnaire he'd created for the business that marketed a certain medicine to young women and girls until the drug caused a suicide and he discovered that the drug was linked to severe depression. He somewhat blames himself for assisting in the promotion of that medication since he assisted in the creation of the website that advertised it, and he wishes he had never participated in the creation of that website. I understand why the author of this post feels a little responsibility for the drug's suicides because he helped market it with the website he developed, but I don't believe he should hold himself to such high standards because he wasn't the one who created the drug or was in charge of its promotion. He didn't know anything about the medication and should have done some research before designing the quiz, but he was new to the company and had no choice but to write what he was told to create. I agree with the author that it is better to follow the code of ethics when it comes to coding, and to only create code that is useful to people and does not promote things that are possibly detrimental to others. I'd be careful to research what I'm coding before doing so, and make sure that whatever I'm helping to promote would not hurt others.


# Ethical dilemma of self driving cars
> This quote from this article points out the main dilemma of the case
> 
"....This revelation suggests the issue isn't solely about ethics, but rather it's also about control. People think ethically in principle, 
but in practice they behave more selfishly,especially if they are not in command of a situation.
Azim Shariff, an associate professor of psychology and social behaviour at the University of California in Irvine and co-author of the study,
says this control factor is fuelling a double standard in how people view themselves and machines......"
#### First of all, I want to mention that just by coincidence, this is exactly what was the reason behind my interest in artificial intelligence.
Three years ago, I attended a scientific conference, the highlight of which was a session entitled "Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged sword", as I remember.
In that session, the example of self-driving was discussed, and many studies and statistics that support the idea of ​​its implementation were mentioned.
I also have an academic scientific background in the field of roads and numbers, as many questions run through my mind
As a result, on a personal level, this is my position on this issue:
- Detailed here is the human factor and acceptance, detachment and discussion of the idea objectively in reality supports the idea.

- The fact that every technological revolution has been met with outright rejection and non-acceptance cannot be obliterated until it gradually develops into the reality that what results from these revolutions is at the present time a necessity and a basic need for living. It is no different with this case.

- It must be taken into account that there are two percentages for the study, the first is the percentage of accidents, and the other is the percentage of damage from the accidents that occur, and in the event that these percentages are reduced, this means the effectiveness of the application of this technology.
