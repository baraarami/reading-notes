Everywhere you look you find that the computer changes the world  , but when most of us use this revolutionary technology daily we don't often ask how do computers work ?
In this page you will know how computer really works 
### starting with what's makes a computer a computer !
### then you look how information is represented useing electresity .
### after that you will know how computer using circutes to semulating the virtual world.
### Next , you will zoom out and look at the different part of a computer that actully input , output and store that information .
### Finally , you gona take a look  what code is actully is and how software controles hardware .
So if you are a curious about the devices that we use it every day i
advice you to take a look of this page and complete reading it . 
computers are everywhere in there packets and in there backpack . Where pioneers of computer science explored how to design a device that can think they realise that it has to perform 
four differnt tasks.

1. It need to take inputs.
it's tell the computer what to do with keybord , mouse , camera , and takes you touch finger as an inpute .

2. store information .
all thess different inputes gives a computer an information which is stored in memoryÿ≤

3. processing .
a computer processer take information from memory  and monipulating them by algorothems wich is just a sereis of command and then send the processed information back to be stored 
in memory again this continue untill the processed information is ready to be an output.

4. and out the result .
it depends on the computer id designed to do 
 

these four things are commen to all computers .
### that's what make a computer A computer. 


in the past the computer was the size of the room and take hours to comlete a process , and calculate numbers but now we use them to talk with each other , playing games , control ropots .

the importent is any number can be represanted with only ones and zeros , more wires you use the more number you con store

using the binary number system you can represint any number you like , but what about other type of information like :
* Text in binary : all the letters inalfabits we can assaigne a number for each of it 

* Image in binary : all of these images , videos and grafics are made of a very tiny dotes called pixels and each pixel have a color each of the colors can be represanted with numbers .

* sound in binary : every sound is basicly aseries of viberation in the air and can be represanted graficly as a waveform and each point on it represinting a number .



# Circuitry can be an art form , like if you have a creative idea you can git that ideaout useing circuits .
every input or output of a computeris effectivlly a type of information which can be represanted by ON or OFF electra signals,  or ones or zeroes , in order to process the information thats comes
in as an inpute and to make the information thats output a computer need to modifay and combine the inpute signels , to do this a computer uses a tiny million electec componants which come toghether to form circuits .


# why are smallest computer are so faster ?
will couse the smalle circuit it is the less distance the signal that have to go .
electricity moves at just about the speed of light which is why modren circuits can perfome billions of 
calculation per second .



As we says before all computers do the same 4 things , they inpute information , store and process this information and then output the information .
each of this is done in a different part of a compyter :
* There are input devices that takes the input from the out side world and convert it into binary information. 
* There is a memory to store these information .
* There is a centeral processing unite or (cpu) that calculate information.
* And finally there id output devices that takes information and convert it into physical output .



# When you look inside the devise of a computer you see :
1. circuits 
2. chips 
3. wires 
4. speackers
5. plugs 
6. staff
##### *This is the hardware*
but what you don't see is a software.
# Software is the all computer programs , codes in this machine 
it can  be :
1. apps
2. games
3. wibsites
4. maps

# But how software and hardware interact with each other ?
lit's start looking on the **CPU** :
which is the main master chip thats conroles all the other parts of a computer .
the real magice of cpu is how it knows which circuits to use , and when to use them .
# Binary code is the most basic form of a software and it's controles all the hardware of a computer



# How can the CPU run music ,chat with me frindes , and watching a video at the same time , for answering that lets go and have a look in operating system of the computer .
the operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer .
operating syster is a program with a special ability that's allows to control the other software in the computer , and inatalling new programes by loadeing them in computers memory .
when you think that your computer runs many programs at ones in reallity the operating system that quickly swiching between programs .

  And at the end i wont to tell you that :
# *Computers have the potentiol to do all kinde of amazing things , but the only thing that's make a computer smart is you*
