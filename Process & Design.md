# This section discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website 
It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:

* How to understand the audience y 
* our site may attract and what information they will expect to find on it
* How to organize information so that visitors can find what they are looking for
* Design theory for presenting information in a way that helps visitors achieve their goals
* Design tips to help you create more attractive and professional sites 

 Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

# Why People Visit YOUR Website
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.

# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
First you want to create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site. You can
then assign the list of tasks to
the fictional visitors you created
in the step described on the
previous page.
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.

# What Information Your Visitors Need
You may want to offer additional
supporting information that you
think they might find helpful.
Look at each of the reasons why
people will be visiting your site
and determine what they need to
achieve their goals.
You can prioritize levels of
information from key points
down to non-essential or
background information.
By ensuring that you provide the
information that your visitors
are looking for, they will consider
your site more relevant to them.

# How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site
PROCESS 460
A website about fashion trends
will need to change a lot more
frequently than one that is
promoting a service that people
do not buy regularly (such as
domestic plumbing or double
glazing).
Once a site has been built, it can
take a lot of time and resources
to update it frequently.
Working out how often people
are likely to revisit your site gives
you an indication for how often you should update the site.
 
 # *Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages*.


 #### *Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.*


* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
  visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
  using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
  the information you present.
