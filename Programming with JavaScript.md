# This repo Explain how javascript can be used in browsers to make website more interactive ,
interesting , and user-friendly . you will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing 
javascript a lot easier .

learning to program with *JavaScript* involves :
1. understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that javascript programmers use to describe them .
2. learning the language itself , and like all languages , you need to know it's vocabulary and how to structure your sentences .
3.becomeing familier with how it's applied by looking at examples commonly used in websites today.


# Before you learn how to read and write the javascript language itself , you need to becone familiar with some key concepts 
in computer programing . they will be converedin three sections:
* A :
 What is a consipt and hoe do I creat one ?
 * B :
 how do computers fit in with the world around them ?
 * C :
 how do I write a script for a web page ?
 
 
 # what is script ?
 it's a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achive a goal .
 to write a script , you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be copleted in order to achive it .
 
 start with the big picture of what you want to achive , and break that down into smaller steps .
 1. Define the coal .
 2. Design the script .
 3. Code each step .
  
  
  # What is a vriable ?
  a script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do it's job. it can store this data in variables .
  once you have created a variable , you can tell it what information you would like to store for you .

  ### Data type distinguished between ##### numbers . ##### strins , and ##### true or false values known as booleans .
  
  # here are six rules you must always  follow when giving a variable a name :
  1. The name must begin with
  a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
  underscore (_). It must not start
  with a number.
  
  2. The name can contain letters,
   numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
   underscore (_). Note that you
   must not use a dash(-) or a
   period (.) in a variable name.

  3. You cannot use keywords or
   reserved words. Keywords
   are special words that tell the
   interpreter to do something. For
   example, var is a keyword used 
   to declare a variable. Reserved
   words are ones that may be used
   in a future version of JavaScript.

   reserved words in JavaScript.

 4. All variables are case sensitive,
   so score and Score would be
   different variable names, but
   it is bad practice to create two
   variables that have the same
   name using different cases. 
   
  5. Use a name that describes the
    kind of information that the
    variable stores. For example,
    firstName might be used to
    store a person's first name,
    l astNarne for their last name,
    and age for their age.
 
 
  6. If your variable name is made
    up of more than one word, use a
    capital letter for the first letter of
    every word after the first word. 
    For example, f i rstName rather
    than fi rstnarne (this is referred
    to as camel case). You can also
    use an underscore between each
    word (you cannot use a dash).
    
    
    
  # An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
      You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).
The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array.
This technique for creating
an array is known as an array
literal. It is usually the preferred
method for creating an array.
You can also write each value on
a separate line:
colors= ['white',
'black',
'custom'];
On the left, you can see an
array created using a different
technique called an array
constructor. This uses the new
keyword followed by Array();
The va lues are then specified
in parentheses (not square
brackets), and each value is
separated by a comma. You can
also use a method called i tern()
to retrieve data from the array.
(The index number of the item is
specified in the parentheses.)
 
 
 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE .

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.




# OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.


ARITHMETIC OPERATORS :
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.
##### ( + , - , / , * , ++ , -- , %)


STRING OPERATOR :
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
There are many occasions where
you may need to join two or
more strings to create a single
value. Programmers call the
process of joining together two
or more strings to create one
new string concatenation.



# What is a function ?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

to creat a function , you give it a name then write the statment needs to achive it task inside the curly braces .
having declared the function , you can then execute all of the statment between it's curly braces with just one line of code *this is known as calling the function*.
sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task . when you declear the function you give it *parametres*
inside the function the parameters acr like variables .
when you call a function that has parameters , you specify the values it should use in the prantheses that follow it's name .
some functions return information ti the code that called them .
