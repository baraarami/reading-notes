# comparison operators 
1. Evaluating conditions :
you can evluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be . the result will be a boolean :true or false .
 
 
 # logical operators
 comparison operators usually return a single value of true and false. logical operatore allow you to comare the result of more than one comparision operatore .
 
 
 
 # loops
 they chick the condetion , if it return true , a code block will run .
 there are 3 kind of loops :
 1. for loop
 2. while loop
 3. do while loop
 
 
 
 for loop uses a counter as a condetion . 
 
 Here are three points to consider when you are working with loops :
 * KEYWORDS :
You will commonly see these
two keywords used with loops 

* break :
This keyword causes the
termination of the loop and tells
the interpreter to go onto the
next statement of code outside
of the loop. (You may also see it
used in functions.)

* continue : 
This keyword te lls the interpreter
to continue with the current
iteration, and then check the
condition again. (If it is true, the
code runs again.)
