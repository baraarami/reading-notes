# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts


### What Is an Object?
An object is a software bundle od related stste and behavior .
software objects are often used in model real world objects that you find in everyday life 


### What Is a class ?
is a blueprint or prototype from which object are created . it intentionally focuses on the basics , showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

""""""""""""""""""(coted)
You've seen classes defined in the following way:

class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and 
    // method declarations
}
This is a class declaration. The class body (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.

# Decimals 
How do Decimal Numbers work? 
Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9


# Binary Numbers
Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1. 


# Hexadecimal Numbers
Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them!

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10 like this:

| Decimal: |	0 |	1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	10 |	11 |	12 |	13 |	14 |	15 |
|----------|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Hexadecimal: |	0 |	1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	A |	B |	C |	D |	E |	F |
